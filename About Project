Goal : To transform the data into a dynamic dashboard that franchise owners can use to identify patterns, trends and oppurtunities for the business

OBJECTIVE 1 - Prepare the data for analysis
- Added a new column to calculate Revenue (price * quantity)
- Added new columns to calculate Month and Day of Week based on the transaction date (BONUS: display them as text (ie “Jan”, “Feb”, “Sun”, “Mon”), instead of numerical values)
- Added a new column to extract Hour from the transaction time

OBJECTIVE 2 - Explore the data with Pivot Tables
- Inserted a PivotTable on a new tab to show revenue by month
- Added two more PivotTables (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by day of week and by hour of day
- Added a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions by product category, sorted descending by transactions
- Added a PivotTable (on the same sheet) to show the number of transactions and revenue by product type, sorted descending and filtered to the Top 15 (by transactions)

OBJECTIVE 3 - Build a dynamic dashboard
- Added Pivot Charts to show revenue by month as a line chart, transactions by day of week and hour of day as column charts, and transactions by product category as a bar chart
- Added a slicer for store location, and connect it to all of the PivotTables on the sheet
- Adjusted formatting, alignment and polish to finalize the dashboard

Result : Observed interesting patterns or trends and suggested recommendations to improve Maven Roasters operations
